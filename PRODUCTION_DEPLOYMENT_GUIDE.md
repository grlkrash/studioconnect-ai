## üîß PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **STEP 1: UPDATE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IN RENDER**

Go to your Render dashboard and update these environment variables:

```bash
# üéØ CRITICAL - ELEVENLABS CONFIGURATION
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_elevenlabs_api_key_here
ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID=pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB  # Adam - Premium Professional Voice

### **STEP 2: DEPLOY TO PRODUCTION**

The code is already pushed to GitHub. Render will automatically detect the changes and deploy:

1. **Go to your Render dashboard**
2. **Find your StudioConnect AI service**
3. **Click "Deploy Latest Commit"** or wait for auto-deploy
4. **Monitor the deployment logs** for success

### **STEP 3: VERIFY DEPLOYMENT SUCCESS**

Watch the deployment logs for these SUCCESS indicators:

```

‚úÖ Fortune 500 Quality: BULLETPROOF

‚úÖ VAD Configuration: OPTIMIZED FOR BUSINESS
```

### **STEP 4: TEST THE VOICE PIPELINE**

1. **Make a test call** to your Twilio phone number
2. **Listen for the new professional greeting**:
   - "Good day! Thank you for calling [Business Name]. I'm your dedicated AI Account Manager, here to provide immediate assistance with your creative projects and strategic initiatives. How may I help you today?"

3. **Test conversation quality**:
   - Speak normally and verify NO phantom "You" transcriptions
   - Confirm voice quality is premium (ElevenLabs Adam voice)
   - Test error recovery by speaking unclearly

### **STEP 5: MONITOR PERFORMANCE**

Check your logs for these performance indicators:

```bash
