# Product Requirements Document: StudioConnect AI

**Version:** 2.0  
**Status:** In Development  
**Author:** Sonia Gibbs
**Stakeholders:** Development Team, Marketing, Sales, Leadership  
**Last Updated:** June 19. 2025

## 1. Introduction: The Problem

Creative agencies thrive on deep work and client relationships. However, their most valuable resources—the time and focus of their project managers, creatives, and leaders—are constantly eroded by a high volume of routine client communication. Every phone call to check a project's status, every email asking about the billing cycle, and every "quick question" is an interruption that forces context switching, kills momentum, and pulls skilled professionals away from billable, high-impact work.

This "interruption tax" leads to decreased operational efficiency, frustrated employees, and a client experience that feels reactive rather than proactive. Smaller agencies struggle to appear professional and responsive, while larger agencies struggle to scale their client service without ballooning their overhead. The risk of service degradation, missed calls, and inconsistent client interactions grows with every new project.

## 2. Vision & Opportunity

Our vision is to transform client communication from an operational bottleneck into a **bulletproof competitive advantage** for creative agencies.

StudioConnect AI will be the **enterprise-grade, AI-powered communication platform** that evolves with an agency's needs. It starts by serving as the perfect, professional front door (capturing leads and qualifying calls with Fortune-500-quality interactions) and matures into an indispensable AI Account Manager that is deeply integrated into the agency's workflow, capable of autonomously handling client service inquiries with unmatched reliability.

By providing a resilient, intelligent, and automated communication layer, we will free agency teams to focus on what they do best: creating exceptional work and building strategic client relationships.

## 3. Target Audience & Personas

We are building this product exclusively for Creative Agencies (branding, web design, marketing, digital, etc.).

### Persona 1: The Agency Owner / Founder
- **Goals:** Drive growth, maintain profitability, establish a premium brand presence.
- **Pains:** Missing new business opportunities after hours, stretching a small team to handle all inbound communication, high overhead costs for administrative staff.
- **Quote:** "I need to know that every potential lead is handled professionally, but I can't afford a full-time receptionist. How do we grow without breaking the bank?"

### Persona 2: The Head of Operations / Project Manager
- **Goals:** Ensure projects are delivered on time and on budget, keep clients happy, maximize team efficiency.
- **Pains:** Constant interruptions from clients asking for status updates, acting as a human router for information, repetitive manual communication tasks.
- **Quote:** "My day is a series of interruptions. If I could just get a few hours of uninterrupted time for my team, our output would skyrocket."

### Persona 3: The Client of the Agency
- **Goals:** To feel informed, valued, and confident that their project is progressing.
- **Pains:** Waiting hours or days for a simple email reply, feeling like they are "in the dark" about project status, not knowing who to contact for what.
- **Quote:** "I just want a quick update, but I feel like I'm bothering them every time I send an email."

## 5. User Stories & Requirements

This product will launch with two distinct tiers:

### Tier 1: PRO Plan ("The AI Studio Manager")
**Focus:** New Business & Professional Presence

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| As an Agency Owner, I want the AI to answer all calls 24/7 so that I never miss a new business lead. | System handles all inbound calls to the designated Twilio number. |
| As a Studio Manager, I want to define a set of qualifying questions so that the AI can vet potential leads. | Admin dashboard allows for creation/editing of a question-and-answer flow for lead capture. |
| As an Agency Owner, I want to receive email summaries and transcripts of calls so that I can follow up. | Email notifications are sent to a designated address upon call completion with a summary, transcript, and lead details. |
| As an Agency Owner, I want to customize the AI's name and voice so that it aligns with my brand. | Admin dashboard provides options for setting the AI's persona and selecting from a list of high-quality voices. |

### Tier 2: ENTERPRISE Plan ("The AI Account Manager")
**Focus:** Bulletproof Client Service Automation & Operational Efficiency (Includes all PRO features)

| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| As a Head of Ops, I want to connect our project management tool (Asana, Jira, Monday) via a secure OAuth 2.0 flow so that the system has authorized, real-time access to project data. | Admin dashboard has a secure section to initiate an OAuth 2.0 connection for supported PM tools; the system handles the token exchange, secure storage, and automated refresh of credentials. |
| As a Head of Ops, I want the system to perform a robust, one-way sync of project data so that our AI has fast, local access to status updates. | System periodically fetches project/task data and stores relevant fields (name, status, details, client) in its own database. A manual "Sync Now" button is also available. The sync process is resilient to API failures. |
| As a Project Manager, I want the system to use Webhooks to receive real-time updates from our PM tool so that the information is always current. | System programmatically registers webhooks and can receive/process events from Asana/Jira/Monday to update the status of specific projects in its database in real-time. |
| As a Project Manager, I want the system to recognize existing clients by their phone number so that they receive a personalized, premium experience. | When a call is received, the system checks the `From` number against the agency's client list in the database and pre-loads their context, including past conversation history. |
| As a Client, I want to ask for the status of my project over the phone so that I can get an instant, accurate update without waiting for an email reply. | If an existing client asks about a project, the AI uses its synced data to provide a specific, accurate, real-time status update, delivered in a natural, conversational tone. |
| As a Head of Ops, I want to build an interactive knowledge base so that the AI can answer common client questions about our agency (e.g., billing, feedback process). | Admin dashboard includes a "Knowledge Base" section where Q&A pairs and informational content can be added for the AI to use in its responses, powered by RAG. |

#### **New: Bulletproof Enterprise Voice Agent**
| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| As a Head of Ops, I want our AI agent to have a premium, natural-sounding voice that is highly reliable. | The system defaults to ElevenLabs premium voices with enterprise-grade settings for clarity and tone. It has a built-in, automated fallback chain (ElevenLabs -> OpenAI HD TTS -> Polly) to ensure 99.99% availability. |
| As a Studio Manager, I want the voice agent to intelligently handle conversational turn-taking and interruptions. | The agent uses advanced, calibrated Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to distinguish speech from background noise. It supports client barge-in, pausing its own speech to listen, and can resume if the interruption is brief. |
| As an Agency Owner, I want to be confident our agent never responds to "phantom" speech or background noise. | A multi-layered phantom speech filter (word count, length, business context patterns, keyword validation) is applied to all transcriptions to prevent false positives and maintain a professional experience. |
| As a Head of Ops, I want the voice system to be resilient to external service failures. | The `ElevenLabsStreamingClient` is built with a circuit breaker pattern, exponential backoff for retries, and continuous quality monitoring to gracefully handle API errors or degradation without dropping calls. |

#### **New: Intelligent Lead Qualification Engine**
| User Story | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------|---------------------|
| As a Studio Manager, I want to define a dynamic, multi-step qualification process for new leads. | Admin dashboard allows creating an ordered list of questions. The `LeadQualifier` service guides the caller through the questions in a natural, conversational flow. |
| As an Agency Owner, I want the system to identify and fast-track urgent leads. | The system analyzes answers for urgency keywords (e.g., "emergency," "ASAP"). Urgent leads are flagged with `URGENT` priority. |
| As an Agency Owner, I want to be notified immediately of high-priority leads. | For leads marked as `URGENT`, the system can trigger an immediate emergency voice call to a designated number, in addition to sending a priority email notification. |
| As a Studio Manager, I want the AI to handle the qualification conversation professionally. | The AI uses context-aware transitional phrases ("Perfect, thank you for that," "Excellent, I've got that") to create a smooth, high-end client experience. |

## 6. Feature Roadmap (Next Priorities)

This section outlines the next set of high-impact features planned for development. These features are designed to deepen our integration into agency workflows and provide proactive, data-driven insights. For a detailed technical breakdown, please see the `docs/feature-plan-intelligence-scope-kb.md` document.

### 6.1. Actionable Client Intelligence
-   **Goal:** Transform raw conversation data into strategic insights for agency owners.
-   **Implementation:** A nightly cron job will analyze the previous day's call logs, aggregating conversation intents (e.g., "status update," "billing question," "scope change").
-   **Output:** A daily email digest sent to the business owner, summarizing the top client conversation trends, enabling them to spot patterns and potential areas for process improvement.

### 6.2. Real-Time Scope-Creep Guard
-   **Goal:** Proactively protect agencies from unbilled work and manage client expectations.
-   **Implementation:** A lightweight intent classifier will run in real-time on every client message. If the intent is classified as a potential "scope_change," the system will trigger an immediate alert.
-   **Output:** An instant email or SMS notification sent to the designated project manager, containing the client's request and a warning of potential scope creep.

### 6.3. Integrated Knowledge Base from PM Tools
-   **Goal:** Empower the AI agent with deep, agency-specific knowledge to answer a wider range of questions accurately.
-   **Implementation:** Agencies will be able to import documents (e.g., project briefs, client onboarding docs, technical specifications) directly from their connected project management tools (Asana, Jira, etc.).
-   **Mechanism:** These documents will be chunked, vectorized using `pgvector`, and stored in a searchable knowledge base. The AI agent will use this RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) source to provide context-aware answers.

## 7. Features Out of Scope (For This Version)

To ensure a focused and timely launch, the following features will not be included in Version 1.0:

- **Two-Way Project Management Sync:** The AI will not create or update tasks in Asana/Jira via voice commands. The integration is focused on reading project data and status.
- **Individual User-Level OAuth:** The integration uses a single, per-business OAuth 2.0 connection, not connections authenticated by individual end-users within the agency.
- **Client-Facing Dashboard:** The agency's clients will not have a portal to log into. All interaction is via voice and other defined channels.
- **Multi-Language Support:** The system will launch with English-only support.
- **Chat/SMS Integration:** This version is focused exclusively on perfecting the voice channel.

## 8. Design & UX Considerations

The user interface for the admin dashboard must be clean, intuitive, and simple. Agency owners are busy and not necessarily deeply technical. The design should inspire confidence and professionalism, mirroring the quality they provide to their own clients. The setup process for integrations and AI configuration must be guided and include clear validation steps.

### 9.4 Integration Architecture

#### Project Management Tools
- **Supported Platforms**: Asana, Jira, Monday.com
- **Core Design**: The integration is built on a provider-based architecture. A common `ProjectManagementProvider` interface defines a contract for all supported platforms, ensuring consistent integration with the core application. This allows for modular, scalable, and maintainable connections to third-party services.

#### Integration Flow
The integration process follows a standardized flow for each provider, consisting of authentication, data synchronization, and real-time updates via webhooks.

1.  **Authentication**: The system uses a secure, per-business **OAuth 2.0 flow** to connect to PM tools. It handles the complete token exchange, secure storage of access and refresh tokens, and automated token renewal to ensure uninterrupted service. For Jira, it requests a comprehensive set of scopes to enable deep, enterprise-level integration.
2.  **Provider Abstraction Layer**:
    - A new directory `src/services/pm-providers` will house the integration logic.
    - An interface `pm.provider.interface.ts` will define the standard methods: `connect(credentials)`, `syncProjects()`, `getProjectDetails(id)`, `setupWebhooks()`, and `handleWebhook(payload)`.
    - Concrete implementations (`asana.provider.ts`, `jira.provider.ts`, `monday.provider.ts`) will implement this interface.
3.  **One-way Initial Data Sync**:
    - Upon successful connection, the system triggers a one-way sync (`syncProjects`) to fetch all relevant projects, tasks, and client data from the provider's API.
    - This data is transformed by a normalization layer into our internal data models (`Project`, `Client`, etc.) and stored in the application's PostgreSQL database.
    - This local copy enables fast, read-only access for the AI agent, decoupling it from the performance of third-party APIs.
4.  **Webhook-based Real-time Updates**:
    - After the initial sync, the system programmatically registers a webhook with the third-party platform (`setupWebhooks`).
    - A single, dedicated API endpoint, `/api/webhooks/pm/:provider`, will receive all incoming webhook events (e.g., `task_updated`, `issue_changed`).
    - The webhook handler validates the request's authenticity (using secrets or signatures) and delegates the payload to the appropriate provider's `handleWebhook` method.
    - The provider then parses the event and updates the relevant records in our local database in real-time, ensuring the AI always has the most current information.
5.  **Data Normalization Layer**:
    - A critical component that translates diverse data structures from Asana, Jira, and Monday.com into our unified `Project` schema.
    - **Example Mappings**:
        - Asana `task.gid` -> `Project.pmToolId`
        - Jira `issue.key` -> `Project.pmToolId`
        - Monday.com `item.id` -> `Project.pmToolId`
        - Asana `task.name` -> `Project.name`
        - Jira `issue.fields.summary` -> `Project.name`
        - Monday.com `item.name` -> `Project.name`

#### Voice Infrastructure (ElevenLabs Native Integration)
- **ElevenLabs Conversational AI Platform**:
  - **Native Twilio integration** with μ-law 8kHz audio format
  - **Built-in turn-taking model** for natural conversation flow
  - **Real-time transcription** with fine-tuned ASR models
  - **Premium TTS** with 5k+ voices across 31 languages
  - **Call transfer capabilities** for human escalation
- **Multi-Tenant Webhook Architecture**:
  1. **Call initiation**: Twilio routes call to ElevenLabs agent
  2. **Webhook trigger**: ElevenLabs calls personalization webhook
  3. **Dynamic configuration**: System returns business-specific settings
  4. **Personalized conversation**: Agent uses custom welcome message, voice, and prompts
  5. **Call logging**: Conversation data stored in StudioConnect database

### Project Management Integration – Detailed Design (v1)

The platform now adopts a **provider-based architecture** for connecting to third-party Project Management (PM) tools. A common `ProjectManagementProvider` interface guarantees consistent behaviour across all providers, ensuring modular, scalable, and maintainable integrations.

#### Supported Platforms
- **Asana**
- **Jira**
- **Monday.com**  
  _(Trello support will be evaluated post-v1)_

#### Integration Flow
1. **Authentication** – Each business connects via a secure **OAuth 2.0 flow**. The system manages the entire lifecycle of access and refresh tokens, including automated renewal, to ensure uninterrupted service. This replaces the previous single API token approach.
2. **Provider Abstraction Layer**  
   - Directory: `src/services/pm-providers/`  
   - Interface: `pm.provider.interface.ts` exposes `connect`, `syncProjects`, `getProjectDetails`, `setupWebhooks`, and `handleWebhook` methods.  
   - Concrete implementations: `asana.provider.ts`, `jira.provider.ts`, `monday.provider.ts`.
3. **One-way Initial Data Sync** – After a successful `connect`, `syncProjects` fetches all projects/tasks, normalises them into internal models (`Project`, `Client`, etc.) and persists them via Prisma.  This local cache guarantees fast, read-only access for the AI agent.
4. **Webhook-based Real-time Updates** – Each provider registers webhooks via `setupWebhooks`.  All events are POSTed to `/api/webhooks/pm/:provider`, validated, and delegated to the provider's `handleWebhook`, which updates local records in real-time.
5. **Data Normalization Layer** – Translates provider-specific payloads into the unified `Project` schema.  Example mappings:
   - Asana `task.gid`  →  `Project.pmToolId`
   - Jira  `issue.key` →  `Project.pmToolId`
   - Monday.com `item.id` →  `Project.pmToolId`
   - Asana `task.name` / Jira `issue.fields.summary` / Monday.com `item.name` →  `Project.name`
