# StudioConnect AI ‚Äì Unified Compliance & Security Roadmap

> **Standards Covered:** SOC 2 (Type II), GDPR, CCPA/CPRA
> **Audience:** Engineering, Security, Product, Legal, & Executive teams
> **Version:** 2.0 (Generated by AI Assistant)
> **Principle:** This is a unified roadmap. Controls are grouped by function, not by standard, to avoid duplication. Most SOC 2 controls are foundational for GDPR and CCPA technical requirements.

---

## 0. Methodology & Phases

We will tackle compliance in a phased approach, focusing on building a strong foundation first and layering on process and evidence collection over time.

| Phase | Timeline | Definition |
|-------|----------|------------|
| üü¢ **Phase 1: Foundational Hardening** | 0-30 Days | Address critical technical gaps, implement core security controls, and lock down infrastructure. This is the hands-on-keyboard phase. |
| üü° **Phase 2: Policy & Process** | 30-90 Days | Draft and approve official policies, define workflows (like change management), and conduct required assessments (like DPIAs). |
| üü† **Phase 3: Audit Readiness** | 90-120 Days | Implement monitoring, run internal tests (like DR and IR drills), and begin systematically collecting evidence for all controls. |
| üîµ **Phase 4: External Audit** | 120-180 Days | Engage with the external auditor for the SOC 2 Type II observation period. Respond to requests and remediate findings. |
| ‚ôæÔ∏è **Ongoing** | Continuous | Activities that must be performed repeatedly (e.g., access reviews, vulnerability scanning, training) to maintain compliance. |

## 7. Will Immediate Steps Alone Deliver Compliance?
* **GDPR & CCPA/CPRA:** Immediate tasks address the most critical code-level gaps but you must also complete policy, documentation, and training requirements (**Short-term phase**) before claiming compliance.
* **SOC 2 Type II:** Compliance is demonstrated by an *external audit over time* (typically 3‚Äì12 months). Immediate steps start technical hardening but you need to implement and **evidence** all controls through the entire audit window.

> **Bottom line:** Immediate üü¢ tasks ‚âà ~40 % of the total journey. Full compliance requires completing üü° and üü† tasks, maintaining ‚ôæÔ∏è activities, and (for SOC 2) passing the auditor's examination.
